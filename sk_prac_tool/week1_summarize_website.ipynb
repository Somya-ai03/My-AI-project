    "---\n",
    "## PART 1 — FOUNDATIONS & ARCHITECTURE\n",
    "### Lakehouse & Databricks Overview\n",
    "- **Lakehouse** merges data lake flexibility with data warehouse management. Databricks implements the Lakehouse\n",
    "using Delta Lake on cloud storage.\n",
    "- **Control plane** (Databricks-managed): user interface, workspace, job orchestration, Unity Catalog control.\n",
    "**Compute plane** (customer cloud): clusters, DBFS, cloud storage (S3/ADLS/GCS).\n",
    "**Layman analogy:** Lakehouse = a modern library: raw manuscripts in basement (lake), curated books on shelves\n",
    "(gold tables), librarian catalog (Unity Catalog).\n",
    "**Exam tip:** Know the roles of control plane vs compute plane and where metadata lives.\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Delta Lake Core Concepts\n",
    "- **ACID transactions**: transaction log (`_delta_log`) ensures commits are atomic and durable.\n",
    "- **Delta log**: JSON + Parquet transaction log; time travel uses versions recorded here.\n",
    "- **Time travel**: `SELECT * FROM table VERSION AS OF n` or `TIMESTAMP AS OF '...'`.\n",
    "- **VACUUM**: removes old files; retains data for default retention; be careful with retention windows.\n",
    "- **Schema enforcement** and **schema evolution**: `mergeSchema`, `overwriteSchema`, `addNewColumns`.\n",
    "- **Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC)**: concurrent writers create commits, Delta verifies against latest state and\n",
    "throws conflicts.\n",
    "**Commands:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "DESCRIBE HISTORY mydb.mytable;\n",
    "RESTORE TABLE mydb.mytable TO VERSION AS OF 3;\n",
    "VACUUM mydb.mytable RETAIN 168 HOURS;\n",
    "ALTER TABLE mydb.mytable SET TBLPROPERTIES ('delta.enableChangeDataFeed' = true);\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Layman analogy:** Delta log is a journal of changes — like saved drafts + edits history for a document.\n",
    "---\n",
    "## PART 2 — CHANGE DATA: CDC & CDF\n",
    "### CDC (Change Data Capture)\n",
    "- Implemented typically via `MERGE INTO` operations using source snapshot or CDC flags.\n",
    "- Pattern: dedupe source, identify inserts/updates/deletes, `MERGE` into target.\n",
    "**Typical SQL MERGE pattern:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "MERGE INTO target t\n",
    "USING source s\n",
    "ON t.key = s.key\n",
    "WHEN MATCHED AND THEN UPDATE SET *\n",
    "WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT *\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Exam tip:** Understand how to pre-process source to avoid multiple matches (use ROW_NUMBER over partition).\n",
    "### Change Data Feed (CDF)\n",
    "- Enable per-table: `ALTER TABLE t SET TBLPROPERTIES (delta.enableChangeDataFeed = true)`.\n",
