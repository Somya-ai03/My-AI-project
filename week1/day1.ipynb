Rather, I execute Jupyter Labs, like this, and give you an intuition for what's going on. My suggestion is that you carefully execute this yourself, <b>after</b> watching the lecture. Add print statements to understand what's going on, and then come up with your own variations. If you have a Github account, use this to showcase your variations. Not only is this essential practice, but it demonstrates your skills to others, including perhaps future clients or employers...</span>\n",

We'll do fun things like have LLMs tell jokes and argue with each other. But fundamentally, my goal is to teach skills you can apply in business. I'll explain business implications as we go, and it's worth keeping this in mind: as you build experience with models and techniques, think of ways you could put this into action at work today. Please do contact me if you'd like to discuss more or if you have ideas to bounce off me.</span>\n",

       "Welcome to the dazzling world of Khan Academy's blog – where the main goal seems to be convincing you that education is supposed to be free, fun, and possibly overachieving with AI. Highlights include futuristic musings on AI helping assessments and a peek into Khan Academy’s “experiment” of becoming its own school district. Oh, and apparently, LearnStorm is the go-to classroom party favor that keeps kids and teachers smiling (or so they say). They also toss in some feel-good success stories about district goals and a plea for donations, because, let's face it, even nonprofit superheroes need cash to keep fighting the good fight. Basically, it’s a mix of shiny new tools, heartfelt missions, and a subtle reminder: Khan Academy is trying to save the world, one lesson at a time."
